            PiyoX is a mobile gaming application that allows high school student to enhance
            their knowledge in mathematic stream. Most of the time high school students are struggling
            with the advanced mathematics. PiyoX can help to get-rid of these mathematic struggles and
            to be a proficient in mathematics. This mobile game help user with four key areas of mathematics,
          </p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Algebraic Expression</li>
              <li>Trigonometry</li>
              <li>Differentiation</li>
              <li>Integration</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            User can select key area of the mathematical problem by selecting the above given areas from the app. Then user can enter the question through question prompt by a specific keyboard to the application. According to the entered question by user, the application generates four answers. Then user should
            select the correct answer among those answers. Then after the system evaluates user's answer and will add marks. Then user can see the step by step answer for the given question whether the answer is correct or not.

          <h1>2.  Background</h1>
          <p>
            Having a better knowledge in advanced mathematic leads to many career opportunities. On the other hand mathematics has become a subject that worth to study because of its elegance. Learn mathematics while challenging at times bring an enormous feeling of accomplishment. So students trend to learn advanced mathematics from their schools. Therefore they always try to refer additional books, e-learning methods etc.
            in order to gain additional knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the immerging technology, calculators, mobile applications, software and other online resources are directly impact on the education process in all sectors. Nowadays students are tend to equip with online learning tools and digital devices.  Many high school students can
            carry their mobile phones to school, use family desktop computer and have access to electronic devices from school. While majority of the school students are already practised the technology-empowered classrooms, teachers also continue to integrate technology-enabled materials in their
            teaching style too.
          </p>
          <p>
            Current educational system in the world highly recommends students to study mathematics in all stages in the school.  There are calculators, number of software such as MATLAB, Microsoft Mathematics etc. and mobile applications to solve advanced mathematical problems. Sometimes these tools only give the
            final answer to the student. If the answer is wrong, there is no way for student to find out where he or she has done the mistake. Sometimes, even students have enough knowledge, they couldn't not apply theoretical knowledge to a real world problem. And also teachers do not have enough time to explain each and every problem in the classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a solution to the above scenarios, I have decided to develop a system that aims certain problem
            areas which most of the students have to face in high school mathematics.

          <h3><li>Physical Classroom</li></h3>

            <h4>Description:</h4>
            <p>
              The school classroom is the place where each and every student take their first step in learning mathematic. It is the best place to learn fundamental mathematics and identify the usability of them in the real life. Generally there are two approaches to provide mathematic instructions. Skill based and concept based.
              The skill based system is more traditional, teachers give in-detailed description on how to solve a mathematic problems. Concept base approach is more practical and teachers encourage students to solve the problems themselves and explain the others how they solve the problem.
            </p>

            <h4>Features:</h4>
            <p><ul>
              <li>Standard based focus on significant skill or concept.</li>
              <li>In order to build new knowledge use prior knowledge and experience.</li>
              <li>Make real world scenarios by cooperative learning.</li>
              <li>Student engagement in activities are high.</li>
              <li>Have a good demand in high order thinking patterns.</li>
              <li>Use student prior knowledge in order to create useful real world applications.</li>
            </ul></p>

            <h4>Advantages:</h4>
            <p><ul>
              <li>Create competition among students.</li>
              <li>Can share knowledge with each other.</li>
              <li>Create new knowledge and can share innovative ideas.</li>
            </ul></p>

            <h4>Disdvantages:</h4>
            <p><ul>
              <li>Cost for physical class room is high.</li>
              <li>Time is limited and the amount of knowledge that can give is limited.</li>
              <li>Cannot focus in each and every student.</li>
              <li>Weak student not get any attention.</li>
            </ul></p>

            <h4>Additional Notes:</h4>
            <p>
              According to my idea, physical classroom is the best way to learn mathematic theories. Nowadays with increasing number of student in a one class room, it is impossible to teach each and every theory to student with different degree of understanding. So with the immerging technology students tend to use technological devices to enhance their knowledge in different formats. So I think engaging with the technology in order to gain knowledge is a big improvement in today’s education system.

              This application solves advanced mathematic problems and do a great job. But in my point of view, the platform is not very user friendly. Colour themes and background features are not attractive. The special keyboard they have used for take input is not in a good standard and some mathematical notations cannot find in that keyboard. So I think the features of the keyboard should be improved.

              Although this application has interactive colour themes and background I think this app is not user friendly. The interaction with tutor happens via text messaging. This is not a good feature of a standard level education application.

              According to my idea using hand writing as the way of rendering input to the application is not good. A significant R&D task should be incorporate with this application to recognize messy type handwriting styles. Writing on a device screen not easy than writing on a paper. So there may be lot of hand writing mistakes are taken place with these difficulties. So the sensitiveness of the responsive area should be high accurate.

              There are four main functions for each give the solution for the syntax validated mathematic problem. All these four functions return a <b>String</b> value which contains the solution with all the steps, related theories and assumptions.
